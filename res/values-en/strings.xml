    <!-- all information -->
    <string name="info_general">General information</string>
    <string name="info_general_text">This application is supposed to support you with your personal training.
        It provides the possibility to create many workouts after your own desires and helps you with the training.
        About 20 to 30 minutes of exercising per day, or at least 3 times a week, are enough to get you in shape and
        make you feel more fit and energetic.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to slim down and to build muscles with your exercises I recommend a healthy
        nutrition in addition. Most of all you should take care of eating much protein and diminish the supply of carbs and
        sugar. So say \"Yes\" to meat, fish, eggs and vegetables and say \"No\" to all food that contains much sugar as well as
        pasta, potatoes and wheat products. So for the time beeing there is no more bakery products and only rarely fruits.
        Even though they are healthy they still contain fructose which would disturb your diet.
        If you still don\&#39;t want to set your apple a day aside you can eat it right after your workout. This way you are
        providing energy to your body and your body can make good use of the fructose.</string>
    <string name="info_exercises">About the exercises</string>
    <string name="info_exercises_text">The exercises of this application are mostly bodyweight exercises.
        That means you can perform them without any aid or tools. You only need you own body.
        That way you can train wherever you are whenever you want!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition every exercise is linked to
        several tags so you know what effect the exercise has to your body. These tags in general represent difrent muscle
        groups. But they only tell you the crucial effect of one exercise. The enumeration of all muscles groups as well as
        their official designation would exceed the purpose of this application and thus were explicitly not integrated
        into this application.</string>
    <string name="info_training">About the practice</string>
    <string name="info_training_text">The supervised training has the purpose to keep you from having to remember all of your 
        workouts. By exercising with your saved workouts the apllication is able to lead you through the whole practice and
        you only have to press one button every now and then to get to your next exercise. This way it will be easier for
        to get and stay motivated for exercising because the next practice is just one click apart.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The warmup:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right before every workout you should warm up properly.
        About 5 to 10 minues of moving your body with an increasing intensity are enough to prevent yourself from getting
        injured and to prepare your body for the upcoming practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;The cooldown:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often underrated but yet neccessary. Cooling down should be a as much of a
        part of your practice routine as the warming up. That is because it slowly calms your body down and prepares it for
        the recovery phase. If you did exercises that mostly had an impact on your stamina it is important to stay in
        more relaxed motion to slowly reduce your pulse. To prevent your muscles from hardening after training and to stay
        agile relaxation and stretching exercises are also an important part of the cooldown phase.</string>
